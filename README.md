## Main goals

- Create a cross platform / open source vector graphics editor.
- Rely heavily on the [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) specification.
- Support [SMIL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_animation_with_SMIL) animations - an extension of SVG allowing to animating SVG elements.
- Include an interactive REPL - a shell which allows you to evaluate clojure code to generate shapes or even extend the editor on the fly.
- Advanced undo/redo - maintain a history tree of all actions and never lose your redo stack.
- Implement built-in accessibility testing features.
