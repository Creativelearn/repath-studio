# Repl module

Based on reepl https://github.com/jaredly/reepl by Jared Forsyth under "ISC License" https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC

## Changes

- Shadow-cljs build
- Conform with replumb breaking changes https://github.com/arichiardi/replumb#usage
- Parinfer removed
- Multiple view and style changes

## Todo

- Separate styles
- Use re-frame to store and retrieve state to global app-db

## Considerations

Maybe switch to SCI https://github.com/borkdude/sci which SCI is simpler, safer and it works when compiled with :advanced.
